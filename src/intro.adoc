== Introduction

Semihosting is a technique where an application running in a debug or
simulation environment can access elements of the system hosting the
debugger or simulator including console, file system, time and other
functions. This allows for diagnostics, interaction and measurement of
a target system without requiring significant infrastructure to exist
in that target environment.

The RISC-V semihosting borrows from the design of other publicly
available and open source semihosting mechanisms to minimize the
development effort required. This specification only defines the
binary interface between RISC-V software and the system hosting
the debugger or simulator.
