== Introduction

Semihosting is a technique where an application running in a debug or
simulation environment can access elements of the system hosting the
debugger or simulator including console, file system, time and other
functions. This allows for diagnostics, interaction and measurement of
a target system without requiring significant infrastructure to exist
in that target environment.

The RISC-V semihosting specification adopts the design of the ARM semihosting
specification cite:[ARMSemihostingRef] to minimize the development effort.
The services defined by the ARM semihosting specification cite:[ARMSemihostingRef]
are portable across different architectures, and only the mechanism of
invoking a semihosting service (aka semihosting binary interface) is
archicture specific. The <<fig_intro1>> below shows an architecture
independent high-level view of semihosting usage.

The RISC-V semihosting specification only defines the semihosting binary
interface for RISC-V platforms and all other aspects of semihosting are
defined by the ARM semihosting specification cite:[ARMSemihostingRef].
