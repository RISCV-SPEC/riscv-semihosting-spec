== Introduction

Semihosting is a technique where an application running in a debug or
simulation environment can access elements of the system hosting the
debugger or simulator including console, file system, time and other
functions. This allows for diagnostics, interaction and measurement of
a target system without requiring significant infrastructure to exist
in that target environment.

The RISC-V semihosting specification adapts the design of the publicly available
and open source semihosting specification cite:[ARMSemihostingRef] to minimize
the development effort. Only the mechanism of invoke a semihosting service
(aka semihosting binary interface) is architecture specific whereas all defined
semihosting services cite:[ARMSemihostingRef] are architecture independent and
resemble system calls of an unix-style operating system. The <<fig_intro1>>
below shows an architecture independent high-level view of semihosting usage.

This specification only defines the semihosting binary interface for RISC-V
platforms and all other aspects of semihosting are defined by the open source
semihosting specification cite:[ARMSemihostingRef].
