== Introduction

Semihosting is a technique where an application running in a debug or
simulation environment can access elements of the system hosting the
debugger or simulator including console, file system, time and other
functions. This allows for diagnostics, interaction and measurement of
a target system without requiring significant infrastructure to exist
in that target environment.
