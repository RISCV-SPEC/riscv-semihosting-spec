== Abstract

Semihosting is a technique where an application running in a debug or
simulation environment can access elements of the system hosting the
debugger or simulator including console, file system, time and other
functions. This allows for diagnostics, interaction and measurement of
a target system without requiring significant infrastructure to exist
in that target environment.

== RISC-V Semihosting

RISC-V semihosting borrows from the design of the ARM semihosting
mechanism to minimize the development effort required. The RISC-V
semihosting is based on the "Semihosting for AArch32 and AArch64:
Release 2.0" specification available here:

	https://static.docs.arm.com/100863/0200/semihosting.pdf

Referring to Chapter Three in that document, the following extensions
are needed to provide RISC-V support.

=== Semihosting Trap Instruction Sequence

Semihosting operations are requested using a sequence of instructions
including EBREAK. Because the RISC-V base ISA does not provide more than
one EBREAK instruction, RISC-V semihosting uses a special sequence of
instructions to distinguish a semihosting EBREAK from a debugger
inserted EBREAK. <<trap>> shows the instruction sequence used to
invoke a Semihosting operation.

.RISC-V Semihosting Trap Sequence
[#trap]
----
slli x0, x0, 0x1f       # 0x01f01013    Entry NOP
ebreak                  # 0x00100073    Break to debugger
srai x0, x0, 7          # 0x40705013    NOP encoding the semihosting call number 7
----

These three instructions must be 32-bit-wide instructions, they may
not be compressed 16-bit instructions. This same sequence is used on
all RISC-V architectures. On systems with paging support, this
sequence must not cross a page boundary as the semihosting system must
be able to check for the semihosting sequence without needing data
from potentially missing pages.

=== Semihosting Register Definitions

<<register>> shows the specific registers that are used, and the size of
the fields in the data block, which depend on whether the caller is
32-bit or 64-bit.
